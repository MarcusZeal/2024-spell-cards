The vessel is captained by a wraith, the quartermaster is a banshee, two wights fill in as boatswains, and the rest of the crew is 16 skeletons. The undead crew are considered proficient with Tools (water vehicles), and the wraith, banshee, and wights are proficient with Tools (navigator's tools). The crew cannot go further than 100 feet from the ship. The undead crew can follow open-ended instructions but can not go further than 100 feet from the ship.",
