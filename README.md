I didn't really love the styles on the available dnd cards out there, so I threw these together. It's not perfect. The JSON is a bit funky with weird line breaks... But it works and looks pretty. If anyone has a better JSON file formatted the same way, it would be mighty easy to swap it in... just saying... 

Anywho - you can run this locally if you have a way to get around the CORS thing (start up a local server). Or you can run it through github at https://marcuszeal.github.io/2024-spell-cards/index.html

The whole purpose of this is to print out prettier cards in 2.5" x 3.5" format. There are much better alternatives to this for digital spell usage... and if I were to print these, I'd probably proof the spell content before commiting to too large of a print. 

Maybe I'll add a way to select certain spells too.. I dunno.
